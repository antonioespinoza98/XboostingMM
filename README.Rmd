# XboostingMM

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

XboostingMM is a semi-parametric model that harnesses the high-performance properties of XGBoost, including its speed, scalability, and superior performance compared to other methods. By integrating mixed-effects models for hierarchical data, this package offers a flexible estimation approach that can bypass traditional linear model assumptions and handle data limitations effectively. This makes it particularly valuable for applications in Small Area Estimation.

The XboostingMM package comprises four key functions: `boost_mem()`, `mem_boost_gll()`, `predict.xgb()`, and `xboosting()`. 

1. **`mem_boost_gll()`**: This function checks the convergence of the algorithm.
2. **`xboosting()`**: This function estimates the XGBoost trees.
3. **`boost_mem()`**: This function leverages the XGBoost trees for the estimation of random effects, iterating until convergence is reached.
4. **`predict.xgb()`**: This function makes predictions using the XGBoost model.

To use the package, start by running `xboosting()` to estimate the XGBoost trees. Then, use `boost_mem()` to apply these trees for random effects estimation. The `mem_boost_gll()` function can be used to monitor the convergence of the algorithm. Finally, `predict.xgb()` can be utilized for making predictions with the trained model.

For further information regarding each function, please refer to the function documentation.
